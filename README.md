# DSA-PROBLEMS 🚀

This repository contains solutions to a variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems sourced from popular competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, SPOJ, and Hackerearth. The goal of this project is to document well-explained solutions to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## 📝 Problems Included

- **Aggressive Cows (GeeksforGeeks)**  
  A popular binary search problem involving placing cows in stalls to maximize the minimum distance.

- **Grid Unique Paths (Leetcode)**  
  A dynamic programming problem to count the number of unique paths in a grid.

- **INVCNT - Inversion Count (Sphere Online Judge)**  
  A classic merge sort-based algorithm to count inversions in an array.

- **K-Special Cells (Hackerearth)**  
  A matrix-based problem involving the identification of "special" cells with certain properties.

- **N-Queens (Leetcode)**  
  A backtracking problem to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C++ (Primary language)
- Standard Template Library (STL) for efficient code
